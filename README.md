# CS361_Homework8
This is homework assignment 8 of my C361 Concurrent Programming C++ Class

# Implementation
- Threads, race conditions, mutual exclusion
- Locks, redezvous/barrier
- Semaphores
- conditional varaibles / producuer-consumer
- Thread-safe queue & thread pool
- Data parallel search 
- Readers, writers, fiarness concepts
- Deadlocks & starvations protection
- Channels & CSP
- Map-Reduce style architecture
- Atomic operations and server-like multi-threaded struct

## Extra
- Create Semaphore class and use it to boudn queue length
- Create a simple ticket lock or bakery lock with atomic to say I did lock algo by my very own hands
- Add timing and scaling measurements for performance vs contention
